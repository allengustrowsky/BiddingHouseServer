# Auction House - Client

The server of an app that creates a virtual auction space where connected users can create auctions and bid/purchase items from other users.  Live communication between client and server is achieved with web sockets.  The client can be found [here](https://github.com/allengustrowsky/BiddingHouseClient).

## Setup
- Install dependencies (e.g., `yarn`)
- Start the server: `yarn start` or `npm run start`

## Usage Notes
